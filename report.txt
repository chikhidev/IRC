IRC SERVER SECURITY & CODE QUALITY ANALYSIS REPORT
==================================================
SPECIFIC VULNERABILITY LOCATIONS
===============================

NOTE: To provide exact line numbers and file locations, I need to examine your source code files.
Please open each file in VS Code so I can analyze the actual implementation.

ANALYSIS NEEDED FOR SPECIFIC LOCATIONS:
--------------------------------------

FILES TO EXAMINE:
1. main.cpp - Entry point analysis
2. Server/Server.hpp & Server.cpp - Core server vulnerabilities
3. Client/Client.hpp & Client.cpp - Client handling issues
4. Channel/Channel.hpp & Channel.cpp - Channel security flaws
5. Services/Services.hpp & Services.cpp - Service layer problems
6. shared/libs.hpp - Common definitions and includes
7. Services/commands/*.cpp - Individual command vulnerabilities

SPECIFIC AREAS TO CHECK:

IN SERVER FILES:
- Socket creation and binding code
- Client connection acceptance loop
- Message parsing functions
- Error handling in network operations
- Memory allocation for client structures

IN CLIENT FILES:
- Authentication state management
- Buffer handling for incoming messages
- Client cleanup on disconnect
- Permission checking mechanisms

IN CHANNEL FILES:
- Channel creation and destruction
- User permission validation
- Message broadcasting logic
- Channel mode enforcement

IN COMMAND FILES:
- Input parameter validation
- Command privilege checking
- Error response generation
- State modification operations

PLEASE OPEN THE FOLLOWING FILES ONE BY ONE:

1. START WITH: main.cpp
   - Check argc/argv validation
   - Port number parsing
   - Server initialization error handling

2. THEN: Server/Server.cpp
   - Socket operations
   - Select/poll implementation
   - Client connection handling
   - Message parsing logic

3. FOLLOWED BY: Each command file in Services/commands/
   - Parameter validation
   - Authentication checks
   - Buffer operations
   - Error responses

TO GET SPECIFIC LOCATIONS:
-------------------------
Open each file in VS Code and I will identify:
- Exact line numbers of vulnerabilities
- Specific function names with issues
- Code snippets that need fixing
- Recommended code changes for each issue
